            <p>Bishop Joseph (born Joseph Zhuk, Йосиф Жук, Polish: Żuk - rendered in English as Zuk) was the first bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America. He was born December 24, 1872 in the village of Pidkamin' in Brody county of the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (now Ukraine). He completed the Theological Seminary in L'viv, was ordained a priest in 1899 and served as secretary to then Bishop of Stanyslaviv (now Ivano-Frankivs'k) Andrei Sheptyts'kyi. He obtained a doctorate in theology from Innsbruck University. He was named prefect of the Greek Catholic theological seminary in L'viv in 1902, then promoted to be its rector in 1904. He was named in 1910 by Pope Pius X to be Apostolic Visitator to Greek Catholic parishes in Bosnia, following which he served as rector of St. Barbara's Church in Vienna, Austria from 1913 to 1920. He emigrated to the United States by way of Canada in 1921, and served as priest at the Greek Catholic parishes in Syracuse NY, Passaic NJ, Allentown PA, McAdoo PA, and Carnegie PA. In 1930, he severed connection to the eparchy of Bp. Constantine Bohachevs'kyi, and was elected bishop of the newly-formed Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America by the 1931 Clergy Sobor in New York. He was ordained bishop on September 25, 1932 despite already apparent illness. As his condition worsened, he was admitted to the sanatorium in Dennisville, NJ, then moved to Florida in January 1934, where he died on February 23, 1934 in St. Petersburg.</p>
