            <p>Oleksander Pihulevs'kyi (also spelled Pihulewsky) was a Ukrainian Orthodox clergyman who served as a deacon and priest primarily in the greater Sydney area of Australia and played a major role in the administration of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Australia. He as born in 1920 in the town of Dyvyn in the Polissia area of Ukraine. He was taken to Germany as a forced laborer by the Nazis, and after the end of the war was in displaced persons camps in Schweinfurt and Aschaffenburg. While in Aschaffenburg, he studied for the deaconate under Fr. Semen Haiuk and in 1947 he was ordained a deacon by Bishop Viacheslav of the Ukrainian Autocaphalous Orthodox Church. In 1948 he emigrated with his family to Sydney, Australia, where he helped to organize a Ukrainian Orthodox parish in the Regents Park immigrant transit camp and was co-founder of the parish of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin. In 1953 he was elevated to protodeacon, and in 1954 was ordained a priest by Archbishop Syl'vestr. He was assigned as rector of the Holy Transfiguration parish in Blacktown, where he remained until 1957, when internal conflicts within the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Australia forced him to join the clergy of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin parish in Homebush. In the 1970s he became the rector of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin parish, as well as a member (and later, the head) of the Consistory of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Australia.</p>
