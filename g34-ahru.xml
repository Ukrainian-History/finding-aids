            <p>Lubow Jowa (Любов Йова, Liubov Iova) is a toxicologist and Ukrainian American community activist. She was born in New York City on October 13th, 1955, and attended the University of Rochester, graduating 1976 with BA in Biology. She received a Masters in Biochemistry from George Washington University in 1979, and a Ph.D. in Toxicology from Rutgers University and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1986. She worked for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the California Environmental Protection Agency as a toxicologist. In the 1980s, she served as Treasurer and active member of the Americans for Human Rights in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Americans for Human Rights in Ukraine (AHRU) was formed in May 1979 by trustees William Bahrey, Walter Bodnar, Michael Chaikivsky, Daniel Marchishin, Ihor Olshaniwsky, John Oryniak, and Ewhen Perejma with the mission of drawing attention to human rights problems in the Ukrainian SSR and to assist the efforts of the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Public Group to Promote and Implement the Helsinki Accords. AHRU reached its peak of activity in the 1980s under the leadership of Ihor Olshaniwsky, but continued to remained active after Ukrainian independence in 1991. It was instrumental in lobbying for the creation of the US Congressional Commission on the Ukraine Famine in 1984, and in helping to defend John Demjanjuk from accusations of being a guard at the Nazi death camp in Treblinka (he was convicted in 1988, but the ruling was overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993 based on exculpatory evidence).
