            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Toma Boshko (Тома Бошко, also spelled Tomasz or Tomko Boszko) was a Ukrainian-American amateur or semi-professional musician who lived at least part of his life in Northampton, Pennsylvania. He was born January 20, 1892, probably in what is now western Ukraine or southeastern Poland. He probably spent some time in the Austro-Hungarian army, as he seems to be familiar with German-language drill commands. He appears also to have participated in the activities of the Sich Athletic and Fire Associations in Ukraine and/or the US.</p>

                    <p>Contains hand-written lyrics of 100 songs. The majority are well-known Ukrainian folk songs, but a number are obscure, or in Lemko dialect or Carpatho-Rusyn. The book is undated, but it may be from the 1920s, based on US postage stamps affixed to the inside front and back covers (Franklin 1908 series 1 cent stamps, and a 10 cent 1894 series Postage Due stamp, which was superceded in 1930). In addition to the song lyrics, it also contains a glossary of military drill commands in Ukrainian and German.</p>
