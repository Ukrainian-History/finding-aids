# Ukrainian History and Education Center - EAD Finding Aids
This directory contains archival finding aids for the processed collections at the Center's archives as EAD XML files. They were generated using Archivists Toolkit, and are released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 license.

### Don't know what that means?
 Then very likely you have stumbled on this directory by accident. No problem: essentially the same information that's in these files can also be found in user-friendly form on [the Center's main website](http://ukrhec.org/collections/archives). In fact, those pages were generated automatically from the data in these EAD files.

### So what ***is*** EAD?

 [Encoded Archival Description (EAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoded_Archival_Description) is a standardized [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)-based file format developed by the professional archives community to store and transmit information about the contents and context of archival collections. It is not really meant to be readable by most human beings (except perhaps those archives professionals who have experience reading/writing EAD files). Instead, it is used to disseminate, share, and aggregate information about archival collections, mainly with the assistance of computer software.
